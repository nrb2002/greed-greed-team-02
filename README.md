  In directing folder,

    director.py was pre-done, except for get_inputs and do_updates. If we can, let's try to only do things to those two sections if we can help it.

    In do_updates,

      



  In services folder,
    keyboard_service.py and video_service.py are pre-done. Do not touch

  In services folder,
    color.py and point.py are pre-done. Do not touch
